This is the repository for any hackersrg-related code. For more details on
hackersrg, visit http://www.hackersrg.com/.

Code is in the following format:

[book-name]/[username]/[code]

...where [book-name] is an indicator of the book, [username] is an indicator of
the hackersrg member who's contributed code, and [code] is, well, the code. At
that point code should be structured to personal preference.
